    <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity is a measure of the efficiency of an algorithm, indicating the amount of time it takes for an algorithm to run based on the input size. An efficient algorithm is one that accomplishes its task with the least amount of time, making it preferable in various applications.
    </p>

    <p>
        Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm requires in relation to the input size. It is often denoted using big-O notation, such as O(n), where 'n' represents the input size. <b>Space Complexity</b> is a crucial consideration in designing algorithms as it impacts the utilization of memory resources.
